About

This project has been created as part of the final project for Gov1005: Data. The project is aimed to show the change in global temperatures over the last century as well as analyse some of the factors that cause it and some of the consequences of this change in climate.

The inspiration for this project is to make it visually obvious how cliamte change is real and how it has the potential to be detrimental to human beings, and life in general.

The code for most plots and world maps can be found in the .Rmd file. The code for the Shiny app as well as the plots and world maps used in the app can be found in the cliamte_change_shiny folder.
